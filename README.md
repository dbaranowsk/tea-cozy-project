static website project

Assignment from CodeCademy to create a static website for a tea company using HTML and CSS.

I was given a redline of the website and images to be included. I recreated the mock up using HTML and CSS, using some properties of Flexbox to help position and display information on the website in an attractive manner.

This was my first project using Flexbox.

Continuing to work on my organization of stylesheet and making it as clean as possible.
